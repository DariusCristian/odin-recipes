    <h2>Desciption</h2>
    <p>A easy recipe for a delicious bolognese-tagliatelle</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 ounces pancetta bacon, finely diced</li>
        <li>3 carrots, finely diced</li>
        <li>3 stalks celery, finely diced</li>
        <li>2 onions, finely diced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound 85% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes, drained</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup beef stock</li>
        <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) box tagliatelle pasta</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook pancetta in a pan over medium heat until it has released its fat and is crisp, 7 to 8 minutes. Add carrots, celery, and onions and cook until the vegetables soften and the onions are translucent, 7 to 8 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a 4-quart pot over medium heat. Break ground beef and pork into small chunks and add them to the pot; cook, stirring lightly, until browned, 7 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir the pancetta-vegetable mixture into the ground meat. Add wine. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir, breaking up the meat until finely ground, wine has evaporated, and the pot is almost dry, 13 to 15 minutes. Add tomatoes, nutmeg, salt, and red pepper. Use the back of a spoon to break up the tomatoes and continue to break down the meat mixture into very small bits, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour beef stock and heavy cream into the pot and reduce heat to the lowest setting. Leave to simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, for at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook tagliatelle at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and drain well.</li>
        <li>Stir pasta into the Bolognese sauce and mix well, adding a little reserved pasta water if needed to develop a satiny coating. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
